Problem sets for Stanford CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs
==============================================================
This repository contains my solution for the assignments in [Stanford CS224W](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/). The solutions are implemented using [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) and [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric).

### Assignments

1. Introduction: We will be doing simple analysis for graphs using Networkx and construct a nobe embedding using PyTorch.
2. Training a graph convolution neural network
3. Implementing GraphSAGE([Hamilton et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216))
4. Implementing GAT([Velickovic et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903))
