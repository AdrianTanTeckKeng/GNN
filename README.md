Problem sets for Stanford CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs
==============================================================
This repository contains my solution for the assignments in Stanford CS224W. The solutions are implemented using NetworkX and PyTorch Geometric.

### Assignments

1. Introduction: Learning nobe embeddings for classification.
2. Training a graph convolution neural network
3. Implementing GraphSAGE[Hamilton et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216)
